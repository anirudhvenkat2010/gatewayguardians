      Dear Parents,
Welcome to the season! We’re excited to have your family as part of the Gateway Guardians and look forward 
to a fun, competitive, and rewarding journey together. As we get started, we want to share a bit about our 
coaching philosophy, which is grounded in the principles of The Matheny Manifesto — a guide that emphasizes 
character, effort, and love for the game above all else.
Our mission is to create an environment where kids grow not just as athletes, but as teammates, leaders, and 
young people of integrity. While we will work hard to teach the fundamentals of baseball, we’re even more focused on helping our players develop life skills that will serve them far beyond the field.
Here are a few core values that shape our approach:
Character First: We care more about who our players are becoming than how many runs they score. Respect, humility, and sportsmanship will always come first.
Effort Over Outcome: Wins and losses don’t define success for us. We celebrate hustle, learning, and the willingness to compete the right way.
Coach-Led Instruction: We kindly ask that parents allow our coaching staff to guide the players during practices and games. This helps keep the message consistent and builds trust between players and coaches.
Let the Kids Play: Our players should feel free to make mistakes, take chances, and play with joy. Baseball is a game — and it should always be fun.
Coachability and Focus: We expect our Guardians to come ready to learn and grow, with a team-first mindset and a positive attitude. That includes being focused and ready to practice, warm up, or play at the scheduled start time — not arriving at that time. As we like to say:
“If you're early, you're on time. If you're ‘on time’, you're late. If you're late, you're rude.”
This approach teaches respect for teammates, coaches, and the game itself.
We believe that by consistently living these values, the Gateway Guardians will be both competitive and successful — not just in the standings, but in how we play the game and represent ourselves as a team.
We’re honored to coach your kids this season, and we’re excited to help each of them take meaningful steps forward — as ballplayers and as people.
Thank you for your support and trust. Let’s go Guardians!
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Head Coach
Gateway Guardians
